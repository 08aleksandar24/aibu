Aibu - image sequence annotator
==============================

Aibu is an image sequence annotator developed and used by the VOT challenge. It can annotate sequence of images and provides several handy features such as interpolation and per-frame label annotations.

The annotator was until now only used within the VOT challenge organization and is therefore considered an alpha level software. A lot of features are missing or are not fully polished. If you find such a case you are welcome to open an issue report on Github.

Building
--------

The annotator is written in Java and can be built using Ant build tool. It depends only on the [coffeshop](https://github.com/lukacu/coffeeshop) library.

Using
-----

There is a short user guide available in the docs folder that should present most of the functionality of the interface.
